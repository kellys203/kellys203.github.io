            <h2>Step 1: Review and Reflection</h2>
            <p>Since Week 9, I have received valuable feedback from peers, reinforcing the importance of creating a welcoming, culturally inclusive classroom. Comments highlighted the significance of my policy statement in fostering Indigenous and non-Indigenous engagement and the effectiveness of activities like the "Story Blanket." The discussions also emphasized the need to align my plan with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action by integrating Indigenous knowledge, traditions, and storytelling into the curriculum.</p>
            <p>Throughout the past weeks, I have deepened my understanding of lifelong learning and the importance of sustained efforts to decolonize and Indigenize education. Recognizing that decolonization involves challenging Western paradigms and Indigenization requires shifting focus toward Indigenous ways of knowing, I have refined my initial proposal to better support meaningful change.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: The Action</h2>
            <h3>Decolonization Action</h3>
            <p>One key decolonization action is to shift away from Eurocentric teaching methods that prioritize written text and standardized testing. Instead, my plan incorporates storytelling, land-based learning, and experiential education that honors oral traditions and community engagement. This challenges Western paradigms by valuing holistic learning approaches and placing Indigenous knowledge on equal footing with Western education models.</p>
            <h3>Indigenization Action</h3>
            <p>To Indigenize the classroom, leadership and decision-making processes will include Indigenous community members, such as Elders and Knowledge Keepers, in curriculum development and classroom activities. This shift ensures that Indigenous perspectives are not just included but centered, promoting Indigenous ways of knowing through storytelling, ceremonies, and interactive learning experiences.</p>

        <section id="plan">
            <h2>Step 3: The Plan</h2>
            <h3>Implementation and Interaction</h3>
            <p>The plan involves redesigning the classroom as a space that fosters Indigenous cultural values through sensory elements and interactive activities.</p>
            <p>A key activity is the "Story Blanket," where students sit in a circle, choose an Indigenous symbol, and create a short story inspired by it. Elders or teachers will guide discussions, sharing traditional narratives.</p>
            <p>The activity will take place both indoors and outdoors, emphasizing the connection between storytelling and nature. This will be an ongoing practice rather than a one-time event, ensuring long-term engagement with Indigenous culture.</p>
            <h3>Sensory Engagement and Cultural Connection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sight:</strong> Indigenous artwork, natural materials like wood and plants, storytelling circle setup.</li>
                <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Traditional drumming, nature sounds, storytelling voices.</li>
                <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Cedar, sage, fresh earth, herbal teas.</li>
                <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Soft furs, woven blankets, smooth stones, clay.</li>
                <li><strong>Taste:</strong> Traditional snacks, herbal teas.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="evaluation">
            <h2>Step 4: Expectation and Evaluation</h2>
            <h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Increased awareness of Indigenous traditions and histories among students.</p>
            <p>Development of respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students.</p>
            <p>A shift in classroom dynamics to incorporate Indigenous perspectives in decision-making and curriculum design.</p>
            <p>Promotion of storytelling and oral traditions as valued methods of learning.</p>
            <h3>Evaluation Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>Student Reflection:</strong> Students will share their experiences and learning through journals or group discussions.</p>
            <p><strong>Feedback from Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers:</strong> Their input will be sought on the cultural authenticity and impact of activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Teacher Observations:</strong> Assessing engagement levels and comprehension of Indigenous teachings.</p>
            <p><strong>Survey or Interview Questions:</strong> Asking students and educators about their understanding of Indigenous knowledge before and after implementation.</p>
